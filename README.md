I wrote a super simple password generator that only creates 18 character passwords out of letters, numbers, and symbols. It's very simple, but I'm just getting started and very proud of it nonetheless. 

UPDATE: I made it a stable lil app that now sits in my toolbar with icon.png as the icon in 48x48p. 
I love it.
